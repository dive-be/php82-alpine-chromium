# php82-alpine-chromium

## What is this?

This is a custom build based on PHP 8.2's Alpine docker image, with changes to make front-end and back-end testing as easy as possible.

## Quick start

In order to build and then test the container:

    docker buildx build . -t diveinteractive/php82-alpine-chromium \
    && docker run -it diveinteractive/php82-alpine-chromium sh

To make an Intel-compatible build on M1, provide the `--platform` flag, but beware that this is slow:

    docker buildx build . --platform linux/amd64 -t diveinteractive/php82-alpine-chromium \
    && docker run -it diveinteractive/php82-alpine-chromium sh

## Automatic builds

The automatically build the container and have it pushed, you must:

* Tag the commit you wish to build
* Create a new release with said tag

The Docker action will automatically build the release and push it under that tag to Docker Hub.

## Where can I find it?

You can find the image on Docker Hub here: https://hub.docker.com/r/diveinteractive/php82-alpine-chromium.
